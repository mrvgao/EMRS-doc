Trash Detection with YOLO
==========================

The **Patrolling Trash-Collecting Robot** employs the YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection model to efficiently identify trash objects during its autonomous patrols.


YOLO Overview
--------------

YOLO is a state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its fast and accurate real-time object detection capabilities. It processes input images in a single pass, identifying and localizing multiple objects simultaneously.

Benefits of using YOLO include:

- Real-time performance
- High accuracy and efficiency
- Ability to detect multiple classes of objects simultaneously


Implementation Details
-----------------------

The robot utilizes a pretrained YOLO model fine-tuned for detecting common types of trash encountered during patrolling:

- **Real-time Inference**: YOLO processes RGBD camera images at high frame rates, allowing immediate trash detection.
- **Class Identification**: Pretrained model identifies various trash categories (plastic, paper, metal, etc.).
- **Bounding Box Generation**: Provides accurate bounding boxes around detected trash objects for further processing.


Integration with ROS2
----------------------

YOLO detection outputs are integrated into the robotâ€™s ROS2 environment as follows:

1. **Image Acquisition**: RGBD camera publishes images to ROS2 topics.
2. **YOLO Detection Node**: Subscribes to image topics, performs real-time inference, and publishes bounding box data to ROS2 topics.
3. **Detection Processing**: ROS2 nodes use YOLO outputs to initiate trash tracking, object pose estimation, and robotic arm manipulation.


Performance Optimization
-------------------------

To optimize detection performance:

- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages GPU hardware to ensure real-time processing capabilities.
- **Model Optimization**: YOLO models are fine-tuned specifically for the environmental context and types of trash encountered, increasing detection accuracy and efficiency.


Integration with Tracking and Manipulation
-------------------------------------------

Detected objects' bounding boxes and classes are further processed to:

- Generate precise TF frames for object tracking.
- Facilitate accurate grasping and manipulation sequences executed by the robotic arm via MoveIt2.

This robust detection framework enables the robot to effectively maintain clean environments through efficient identification and collection of trash.
