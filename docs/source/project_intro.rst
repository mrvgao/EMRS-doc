Patrolling Trash-Collecting Robot
=================================

The **Patrolling Trash-Collecting Robot** project brings together a mobile robotic platform, a manipulator arm, and intelligent perception and navigation systems to autonomously patrol an environment and collect small trash objects. This system is built on ROS2 and supports both simulation in Ignition Gazebo and deployment on a real TurtleBot4-based hardware platform.

Overview
--------

This project explores robotic autonomy through integrated subsystems for navigation, perception, and manipulation. The robot autonomously navigates a mapped space, detects trash using computer vision, approaches the object, and uses a robotic arm to pick and store it.

The full system has been implemented both in simulation and on a real robot, offering a complete pipeline from software development to real-world deployment.

We provide two branches for different use cases:

- **`sim` branch**: Implements the system in a simulated environment using **Ignition Gazebo**, allowing testing and development without hardware.
- **`real` branch**: Deploys the same architecture on a physical **TurtleBot4** platform, integrating real sensors and actuators.

.. _hardware_used:

Hardware Used
-------------

The real-robot system is built using the following hardware:

- **Mobile Base**: TurtleBot4 (iRobot Create3 chassis)
- **Manipulator**: OpenManipulator-X (by Robotis)
- **Sensors**:
  - **Lidar (2D)**: Integrated with TurtleBot4
  - **RGBD Camera**: Intel RealSense D435 (or equivalent)
- **Onboard Computer**: Raspberry Pi 4 (provided with TurtleBot4), or external PC via Wi-Fi
- **Power Supply**: Battery integrated into TurtleBot4

Simulation Environment
----------------------

For development and testing, the following simulation tools and packages are used:

- **Ignition Gazebo**: Full 3D physics simulation with robot model and a custom room/lab world.
- **RViz2**: 3D visualization of the robotâ€™s perception and planning.
- **MoveIt2**: Motion planning for the OpenManipulator-X in simulation.
- **Nav2**: Autonomous navigation stack.
- **Custom URDFs**: Combining TurtleBot4, sensors, and OpenManipulator into a single model.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Follow the steps below to install required dependencies and set up the workspace for this project.

1. Install ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04 following the official guide.
2. Install Gazebo Ignition:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
       ros-humble-ros-ign-bridge \
       ros-humble-ros-ign-gazebo \
       ros-humble-ros-ign-image \
       ros-humble-ros-ign-gazebo-demos

3. Install MoveIt2 and related dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-humble-moveit* \
       ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui \
       ros-humble-rqt* \
       ros-humble-xacro

4. Clone the repository and build the workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p ~/rsp_ws/src
   cd ~/rsp_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/mrvgao/rsp-proj.git

   cd ~/rsp_ws
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   colcon build --symlink-install
   source install/setup.bash

5. Choose a branch for your use case:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/rsp_ws/src/rsp-proj
   git checkout sim   # or 'real' for hardware setup

.. _execution:

Running the System
-------------------

To launch the robot in Ignition with localization and Nav2 enabled:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch turtlebot4_manipulator_ignition \
     t4_manipulator_ignition.launch.py localization:=true nav2:=true slam:=false

To start patrolling behavior:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch turtlebot4_manipulator_navigation \
     patrol.launch.py

Edit the file `config/patrol_waypoints.yaml` to customize patrol routes.
