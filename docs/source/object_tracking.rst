Object Tracking with TF and PID Control
========================================

The **Patrolling Trash-Collecting Robot** employs a robust tracking mechanism based on ROS2 TF frames and PID control algorithms to accurately align with and approach detected trash objects.


TF-Based Object Tracking
-------------------------

After trash objects are detected by YOLO, their positions are represented using TF frames (Transform Frames) within the ROS2 environment. TF frames provide real-time positional relationships between coordinate systems:

- **TF Generation**: Once an object is detected, a TF frame is generated and placed at an optimal grasping location relative to the detected trash object.
- **Continuous Updates**: TF frames are continuously updated using the latest sensor data, maintaining an accurate and dynamic reference for tracking.


PID Control for Alignment
--------------------------

A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is used for precise alignment of the robot with the trash object:

- **Proportional Control (P)**: Calculates control commands based on the current positional error.
- **Integral Control (I)**: Addresses accumulated past errors to correct systematic deviations.
- **Derivative Control (D)**: Predicts future positional errors based on current rates of change, smoothing the robot’s movements and minimizing overshoot.

The PID controller continuously receives positional errors from the difference between the robot’s current position and the object's TF frame, calculating necessary adjustments to position accurately.


Implementation Workflow
------------------------

The typical workflow for TF-based tracking with PID control:

1. **Object Detection and TF Creation**: YOLO detects an object, and a TF frame is generated.
2. **Error Calculation**: Positional errors between the robot’s current pose and the TF frame are computed.
3. **PID Control Execution**: PID controller calculates corrective commands to minimize positional errors.
4. **Robot Movement**: Commands are executed to align and approach the object smoothly and accurately.


ROS2 Integration
-----------------

ROS2 nodes handle the integration of TF tracking and PID control:

- **TF Broadcaster Node**: Publishes the TF frames generated from detected object positions.
- **PID Controller Node**: Computes and publishes movement commands based on TF positional errors.
- **Robot Driver Node**: Receives PID-generated commands and translates them into precise robot motions.


Robustness and Reliability
---------------------------

This integration of TF-based tracking and PID control ensures:

- High reliability and accuracy in object alignment
- Smooth, precise robot movements for efficient trash collection
- Adaptability to dynamic environments and varying object positions

The combined tracking and control framework significantly enhances the robot’s ability to autonomously and efficiently collect trash.
