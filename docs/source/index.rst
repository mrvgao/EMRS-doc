Project Overview
----------------

The **Patrolling Trash-Collecting Robot** project aims to develop an autonomous mobile robot equipped with a robotic arm designed to patrol designated areas, detect and collect trash, and deposit it into a designated trash receptacle. The robot combines advanced navigation techniques, real-time object detection, precise manipulation, and robust mapping capabilities to autonomously maintain cleanliness and environmental hygiene.

Key Functionalities:

- Autonomous Navigation and Mapping (Nav2)
- Eye-Hand Calibration
- Real-time Trash Detection and Tracking (TF frames)
- Object Segmentation and Pose Estimation (Point Cloud Analysis)
- Robotic Arm Manipulation (MoveIt2, Pick-and-Place)
