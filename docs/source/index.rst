Project Overview
----------------

The **Patrolling Trash-Collecting Robot** project aims to develop an autonomous mobile robot equipped with a robotic arm designed to patrol designated areas, detect and collect trash, and deposit it into a designated trash receptacle. The robot combines advanced navigation techniques, real-time object detection, precise manipulation, and robust mapping capabilities to autonomously maintain cleanliness and environmental hygiene.

Key Functionalities:

- Autonomous Navigation and Mapping (Nav2)
- Eye-Hand Calibration
- Real-time Trash Detection and Tracking (YOLO, TF frames)
- Object Segmentation and Pose Estimation (Point Cloud Analysis)
- Robotic Arm Manipulation (MoveIt2, Pick-and-Place)


Documentation Structure
-----------------------

This documentation is structured into several sections, each detailing specific aspects of the robotâ€™s functionality and implementation. Users and developers can navigate through these sections to understand and replicate the system, extend capabilities, or adapt the platform for related applications.

.. note::
   All project tasks and features described are assumed to be fully implemented and tested in simulation and real-world environments.
